# TerminalForGaming

## Description
TFG (Terminal For Gaming) is portable gaming console based in Raspberry Pi 400 and Arduino.
This is a joint project between Hugo Ribeiro (Fatherboard) and Alejandro Baonza (Algonzbao), made as a final project for the computer engineering degree at the Complutense University of Madrid but with the intent of sharing it afterwards for hobbyists that would like to replicate the project on it's current state or continue with the development according to their preference.

This project includes gerber files (alongside the project in Fusion360 for possible editing) so that the user can order the custom PCBs,  the .STL files for 3D printing the housing of T.F.G and all the software needed to program the Arduino Pro Mico and have the custom menus for ease of access to the games and setting up the console.
The console uses as its operating system Raspberry OS, previously known as Raspbian (https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) alongside our custom menus to access various emulators from RetroPie or game streaming services like Steam Link, Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, among others.
